      <h3 class="text-center heading">Hi, My Name is Alex Sanchez</h3>
      <p>
        Currently a student at
        <a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/">Nashville Software School</a>, Evening Cohort 6, I began learning web development in late 2016 in my free time with
        the aid of online courses and tutorials.
        <br>
        <br> In 2017 I decided to take the leap and enroll in the NSS evening program to further my learning.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p> I am a firm believer in life-long learning and what I've experienced so far is that this field requires constant growth;
        Technologies are constantly evolving and we as developers must recognize the power of change and always be ready
        for the next challenge.
        <br>
        <br> Every day offers the chance to discover something new and that always fills me with excitement.
      </p>
